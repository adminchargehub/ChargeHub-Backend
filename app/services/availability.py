"""Availability engine — "find the earliest free outlet".

This is the one piece of genuinely valuable business logic in the 2016
prototype, and the only part the blueprint is right to call reuse. The original
(described in `website_structure.md`) read the *last* `timeExpire` from each
`socketN` table, took the earliest, and appended the requested hours.

That has two defects this version fixes:

1. It could only ever append to the end of a queue. It never found a *gap*
   between two existing bookings, so an outlet free 09:00–13:00 between two
   bookings was invisible to it.
2. "Last recorded" meant highest id, not latest time — so an out-of-order
   insert silently produced a double-booking.

Windows are half-open ``[starts_at, ends_at)``: a booking ending at 14:00 and
one starting at 14:00 do not conflict.
